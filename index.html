					&emsp;iWantSeats (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) shall serve as an online

					Company&rsquo;s customer (&ldquo;Customer&rdquo;), through online
					booking. The Company shall not be considered an agent of the
					Operator as a common carrier nor shall it share in the obligations
					and liabilities of the Operator as a common carrier. The Company
					shall not be included as a party to the contract of carriage between
					Operator and Customer. The Company shall provide and maintain an
					online booking facility to assist a Customer who wants to book a bus
					ticket online. Its obligations shall be limited to its role as an
					online booking facility and shall not be liable to the Customer as a
					common carrier or an agent of the common carrier.<br />

					&emsp;The Company shall reflect the schedule of fares and fees which
					it warrants as true and correct as of the time of publication. For
					facilitating the online booking of tickets, the Company shall
					collect a web service convenience fee of Php 50 for each passenger
					booked, inclusive of VAT, per passenger. This fee is on top of the
					regular fare and fees charged by the Operator. The web service
					convenience fee shall be non-refundable. There may be additional
					service charges for payment facilities or other services used. Upon
					confirmation of the booking, an eTicket Itinerary shall be sent to
					the Customer. The Customer shall shoulder any government taxes,

					<strong>REFUND, REBOOKING AND CANCELLATION OF BOOKINGS</strong><br />
					&emsp;The Company may charge 30% of the total amount paid for

					operator, or depending on the rebooking or refund policy of the
					operator.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<strong>EMBARKATION DEADLINES</strong><br />
					&emsp;The Customer shall be required to check-in at the terminal at
